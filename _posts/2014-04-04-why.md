The [Ember App Kit](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit) (_now deprecated_) project proved to be quite useful.
We've learned a lot, and it allowed us to iterate quickly while building real ambitious applications.

While it's initial incarnation was useful, it had several meta problems:

1. It was not "simple" and appeared daunting
2. Because of inline configuration, the API surface area was massive
3. 2 did not allow users to express the "what", just the "how". This prevented Ember App Kit from doing more of the heavy lifting itself
4. 2 and 3 made it quite tedious to upgrade

### Rationale for #3

If we want to upgrade or swap in a faster build pipeline it would be a major pain currently. But with #3, in theory, it should be minimal pain.
